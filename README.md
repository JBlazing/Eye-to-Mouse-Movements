# Eye-to-Mouse-Movements

This was a project that was done during the Fall Semester of 2016 for Human Computer Interaction class that I took. The purpose of this project was to allow eye tracking to move a mouse cursor in a X11 enviroment.

Thank you to this implementation of the [eye-center algorithm by Fabian Timm](https://github.com/trishume/eyeLike)  

A demo of the project can be seen playing the game slither.io

This Currently this requires either Opencv 2.x or 3.x C++ libary install and X11 libaries installed.
